      "Matt Sebastian is the Founder and President of Called and Chosen – a Catholic non-profit organization focused on Evangelization. He spent 20+ years in the Washington DC Metro area, where he was involved in Evangelization Ministries and Faith Groups in various capacities within Catholic Churches in the Arlington Diocese in VA. In 2016, he moved to the Raleigh RTP region to take up a corporate role of a Director of a Solutions Business Unit for a large Software organization. He simultaneously got active in the local Parish Retreat Ministry and Prayer Groups in the Chapel Hill area. He holds a MBA (International Business and Finance) from Georgetown University, DC and a Bachelor’s degree in Engineering (Electronics and Telecommunications).",
      "Matt was raised in a devout Catholic family but strayed away from faith in his mid-late twenties, lured by life’s myriad influences into materialism, modernism and relativism. In his early thirties, a life-changing episode involving the near-death experience of his 18-month-old daughter, brought him back to the faith, with a renewed zeal to seek our Lord. His understanding of God’s love and mercy was further nourished through a series of Retreats led by the Vincentian Priests, that he attended in the mid-2000’s timeframe. Over the past 15+ years of his spiritual quest, he has experienced immense grace and joy seeking meaning in life through Christ. This pursuit led him to further evolve and serve as a Catholic Evangelist in the Divine Healing Ministry within the US and in parts of South-East Asia and Europe. He works with Missionary Priests of the Congregation of St. Vincent De Paul in bearing witness to Christ.",
      "Matt co-founded the Life in Christ Prayer Group in 2017, a Parish Ministry in Chapel Hill through which he continues to evangelize the Good News and intercede for the anointing of the Holy Spirit within local Parish and Diocesan circles. In 2019, he assumed Leadership for the Annual Parish Retreat in St. Thomas More Catholic Church, Chapel Hill NC, where he continues to lead a core committee in spreading the message of God’s love and mercy. He works closely with the Diocese of Raleigh’s Office of Evangelization and Discipleship to lead broader evangelization efforts through the Called and Chosen Evangelization Ministry."

      "Joe Zannini earned his Bachelor’s and Master’s Degree from the University of Rhode Island and his PhD from the University of Nebraska. He served as Assistant Dean of Students at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, Associate Vice Provost for Resident Life at the University of Cincinnati, and Executive Director of Housing Services, and Associate to the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst. In the role of chief disciplinarian at each of these schools, Joe felt the need to assist students in taking responsibility for their behavior and assisting students with the development of positive life skills. From the core of these programs, Joe developed supervisory skills that he transmitted to his managers and to numerous national audiences.",
      "After having made a Worldwide Marriage Encounter retreat in 1973, Joe and his wife, Yvette, conducted love and marriage classes for high school seniors for over 25 years. Although Joe and his wife had a Christ centered marriage and even though he was chair of parish councils in four different states, Joe remained a “Closet Catholic.” He went along with the cultural morae that one’s faith should be private. Speaking about Jesus in the public square was an anathema. A son-in-law, a convert to Catholicism, became his role model for the public proclamation of the faith. The liberty that Joe derived from being able to proclaim his faith has allowed him to enter into a deeper loving relationship with Christ.",
      "After studying Sherry Weddell’s book, Intentional Discipleship with the St. Thomas More Parish Council, Joe was invited to attend an associated Catherine of Siena Institute workshop in Colorado. The workshop was a catalyst for his inspiration into broader evangelization efforts with the Called and Chosen Evangelization Ministry. Joe has also presented in the “Called and Gifted program,” and for the past six years Joe has been lead in the St. Thomas More’s Yokefellow Prison Ministry program."

      "Bryon Herbel is a Midwesterner who completed his psychiatry residency in Kansas in 1990, after which he moved to North Carolina to enroll in a two-year fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center. Intrigued by the interface between psychiatry and the criminal justice system, he began working as a correctional and forensic psychiatrist at the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina. After a 25-year career with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, he retired in 2017 and subsequently relocated to North Dakota in order to be near family members.",
      "Bryon was raised in a Catholic family but lost his faith while in college, essentially becoming an atheist for a five-year period. His confidence in his atheist beliefs dissolved during his medical training after encountering the great pain and suffering endured by some individuals, including episodes of watching frightened patients die right in front of him. He began a search for deeper meaning in life, eventually returning to the Catholic Church. His faith deepened and matured during his many years as a correctional psychiatrist, wrestling with the mystery of suffering from a Catholic perspective.",
      "Bryon has conducted several psychiatric evaluations on people who claimed to be victims of demonic possession, and was part of a prayer group supporting a team of Exorcist Priests who conducted the formal Rite of Exorcism over two victims in Durham. Over the past several years, his background in teaching about evangelization and the Holy Spirit for a couple of prayer groups in the Raleigh-Durham area has inspired his zeal for evangelization efforts in a broader context via the Called and Chosen Evangelization Ministry. His recent immersion in Carmelite spirituality and the traditional Latin Mass has further stoked his zeal to share the joy of a relationship with Christ with others."

On December 29, 1969 she and her husband Bob had the first ecumenical wedding at Saint Andrew’s Methodist Church in Orangeburg, SC. A few years later she joined the Catholic Church.

      "Beth Lutz was raised in a Catholic family in Southborough, Massachusetts and went to church on Sundays and holy days like most “good Catholics” but had no idea what it meant to have a personal relationship with God. She felt a bit resentful that she had been raised with good moral values in a world that didn’t appreciate them. After leaving for college, she was drawn to the secular culture and stopped going to church.",
      "It was only in desperation that she occasionally began to seek God’s help. First it was a difficult boss, then it was an inconclusive ultrasound that could indicate a birth defect and then it was financial struggles. God was always there when she needed wisdom and guidance but soon after she forgot him and got lost in the busyness of running her own public relations consultancy, being a wife and the mother of four young children.",
      "But God kept seeking her. A flyer offering free childcare was all the incentive Beth needed and she signed up for a Ministry of mother’s Sharing (MOMS) 8-week program being offered at her church. It was a life altering experience. For the first time she was surrounded by other Christian women who spoke of the amazing love and mercy of Jesus and how they surrendered their troubles to him. They had so much joy. Beth wanted that too.",
      "Shortly after finishing this program Beth and her family moved to Bedford, NH. Despite feeling like he was asking the wrong person, Beth was convinced that God wanted her to start MOMS there. Timidly, she said YES and co-founded the MOMS program. Over 10 years the program flourished, and more than 125 women graduated. This one YES blessed Beth in more ways than she could have ever imagined. She met some of her best friends who also became sisters in Christ. She joined in prayer with her MOMS friends and continued to grow in her faith and completed Life in the Spirit. She became a eucharist minister, religious education teacher and even partnered with some of her friends to give Women at the Well retreats for other women searching for a deeper relationship with God. She and her husband Jonathan also joined a catholic couple’s group. They shared so much laughter and joy with the other couples it quickly became the social highlight of their month.",
      "In August of 2019, Beth moved with her family to Chapel Hill and is loving her first bible study. She is on the steering committee for the Evangelization prayer group at St. Thomas More. She is a eucharist minister and has taught religious education. She loves sharing the amazing ways God has touched and truly transformed her life."
