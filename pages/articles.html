                            The person I recall when I think about someone who is not necessarily Christian, but has good moral values, is a young man who was my next door neighbor for many years. Although not Christian, but belonging to another faith,  and even being agnostic to that faith for most part,  he displayed rare prudence, courage,temperance and justice, exuding all the cardinal virtues...

                        <p class="card-text">
                            The fact that God gave us His only begotten Son, who though fully Divine, yet came down as fully human, to experience humanity’s frailty while remaining sinless, was in itself a supreme act of humility and sacrifice. This element of Christ’s sacrifice continued all through His life, in His suffering, and Death on the Cross when He took on all of humankind’s sin and offered it for the redemption of mankind. In his death as paschal sacrifice, he overcame death by resurrection and ascension into Heaven, thereby laying the cornerstone for humanity’s salvation into eternal life or the Kerygma (Greek) as defined by St. Paul. We as Christians are called to embrace this Paschal Christology knowing that in our suffering we unite ourselves to Christ’s suffering on the Cross, so we find redemptive meaning in the suffering, ultimately intensifying our quest for God and leading us to salvation. My suffering can also be redemptive for others – and when I suffer my will can be joined to Christ’s will – and completes Jesus’ suffering on the Cross, just as the Church (His mystical body) completes the redemptive work of Christ (cf. Colossians 1:24). Likewise, all men and women, regardless of whether they are Christian or non-Christian, unite their struggles and suffering with Christ’s suffering, and without them necessarily knowing, Christ silently suffers with them. A Christian says ‘We don’t suffer alone. God suffers with us.’ Christ meets everyone in the darkest moments of life, regardless of where they are in their spiritual journey, whether they have professed their faith in Him, or whether they are non-Christian. He turns all suffering for the good of all those who are called according to His purpose (cf. Romans 8:28).

                                Further, Paschal Christology expounds that all humans partake in the paschal mystery of Christ when they look beyond themselves and develop a calling to be with their neighbor in their suffering, just as the Good Samaritan did. We don’t have to say much, just unleash love from our hearts for those suffering and be there for them. This transformation of human attitude is made possible by embracing the Christian faith in the Church. But, can work well outside the Church as well (cf. Acts 17:23), so long as people can embrace similar corporal works of mercy such as feeding the poor, caring for the sick, visiting the imprisoned etc. Christ as a role model and His teachings on the beatitudes thereby become a standard for all humanity to aspire to when they partake in such works.
