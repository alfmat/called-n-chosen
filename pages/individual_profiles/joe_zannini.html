                    <h1>Joe Zannini</h1>
                    <p class="text-muted">Vice President, Evangelization</p>
                    <p>
                        Joe Zannini earned his Bachelor’s and Master’s Degree from the University of Rhode Island and his PhD from the University of Nebraska. He served as Assistant Dean of Students at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, Associate Vice Provost for Resident Life at the University of Cincinnati, and Executive Director of Housing Services, and Associate to the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs at the University of  Massachusetts - Amherst.  In the role of chief disciplinarian at each of these schools, Joe felt the need to assist students in taking responsibility for their behavior and assisting students with the development of positive life skills.    From the core of these programs, Joe developed supervisory skills that he transmitted to his managers and to numerous national audiences.

                        After having made a Worldwide Marriage Encounter retreat in 1973, Joe and his wife, Yvette, conducted love and marriage classes for high school seniors for over 25 years.   Although Joe and his wife had a Christ centered marriage and even though he was chair of parish councils in four different states, Joe remained a “Closet Catholic.”  He went along with the cultural morae that one’s faith should be private.  Speaking about Jesus in the public square was an  anathema. A son-in-law, a convert to Catholicism, became his role model for the public proclamation of the faith.  The liberty that Joe derived from being able to proclaim his faith has allowed him to enter into a deeper loving  relationship with Christ.

                    <p>
                        After studying Sherry Weddell’s book, Intentional Discipleship  with the St. Thomas More Parish Council, Joe was invited to attend an associated Catherine of Siena Institute workshop in Colorado.  The workshop was a catalyst for his inspiration into broader evangelization efforts with the Called and Chosen Evangelization Ministry.  Joe has also presented in the “Called and Gifted program,” and for the past six years Joe has been lead in the St. Thomas More’s Yokefellow Prison Ministry program.
