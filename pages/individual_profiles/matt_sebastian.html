                    <p class="text-muted">Founder & Chairman</p>
                    <p>
                        Matt Sebastian is the Founder and President of Called and Chosen – a Catholic non-profit organization focused on Evangelization. He spent 20+ years in the Washington DC Metro area, where he was involved in Evangelization Ministries and Faith Groups in various capacities within Catholic Churches in the Arlington Diocese in VA. In 2016, he moved to the Raleigh RTP region to take up a corporate role of a Director of a Solutions Business Unit for a large Software organization. He simultaneously got active in the local Parish Retreat Ministry and Prayer Groups in the Chapel Hill area. He holds a MBA (International Business and Finance) from Georgetown University, DC and a Bachelor’s degree in Engineering (Electronics and Telecommunications).

                        Matt was raised in a devout Catholic family but strayed away from faith in his mid-late twenties, lured by life’s myriad influences into materialism, modernism and relativism. In his early thirties, a life-changing episode involving the near-death experience of his 18-month-old daughter, brought him back to the faith, with a renewed zeal to seek our Lord. His understanding of God’s love and mercy was further nourished through a series of Retreats led by the Vicentian Priests, that he attended in the mid-2000’s timeframe. Over the past 15+ years of his spiritual quest, he has experienced immense grace and joy seeking meaning in life through Christ. This pursuit led him to further evolve and serve as a Catholic Evangelist in the Divine Healing Ministry within the US and in parts of South-East Asia and Europe. He works with Missionary Priests of the Congregation of St. Vincent De Paul in bearing witness to Christ.

                        Matt co-founded the Life in Christ Prayer Group in 2017, a Parish Ministry in Chapel Hill through which he continues to evangelize the Good News and intercede for the anointing of the Holy Spirit within local Parish and Diocesan circles. In 2019, he assumed Leadership for the Annual Parish Retreat in St. Thomas More Catholic Church, Chapel Hill NC, where he continues to lead a core committee in spreading the message of God’s love and mercy. He works closely with the Diocese of Raleigh’s Office of Evangelization and Discipleship to lead broader evangelization efforts through the Called and Chosen Evangelization Ministry.
