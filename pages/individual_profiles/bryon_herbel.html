                    <p class="text-muted">Vice President, Apologetics</p>
                    <p>
                        Bryon Herbel is a Midwesterner who completed his psychiatry residency in Kansas in 1990, after which he moved to North Carolina to enroll in a two-year fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center.  Intrigued by the interface between psychiatry and the criminal justice system, he began working as a correctional and forensic psychiatrist at the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina.  After a 25-year career with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, he retired in 2017 and subsequently relocated to North Dakota in order to be near family members.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bryon was raised in a Catholic family but lost his faith while in college, essentially becoming an atheist for a five-year period.  His confidence in his atheist beliefs dissolved during his medical training after encountering the great pain and suffering endured by some individuals,  including episodes of watching frightened patients die right in front of him.  He began a search for deeper meaning in life, eventually returning to the Catholic Church.   His faith deepened and matured during his many years as a correctional psychiatrist, wrestling with the mystery of suffering from a Catholic perspective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bryon has conducted several psychiatric evaluations on people who claimed to be victims of demonic possession, and was part of a prayer group supporting a team of Exorcist Priests who conducted the formal Rite of Exorcism over two victims in Durham.  Over the past several years, his background in teaching about evangelization and the Holy Spirit for a couple of prayer groups in the Raleigh-Durham area has inspired his zeal for evangelization efforts in a broader context via the Called and Chosen Evangelization Ministry. His recent immersion in Carmelite spirituality and the traditional Latin Mass has further stoked his zeal to share the joy of a relationship with Christ with others.
