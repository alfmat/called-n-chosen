                    <h1>Beth Lutz</h1>
                    <p class="text-muted">Manager, Promotions & Marketing</p>
                    <p>
                            Beth Lutz was raised in a Catholic family in Southborough, Massachusetts and went to
                            church on Sundays and holy days like most “good Catholics” but had no idea what it
                            meant to have a personal relationship with God. She felt a bit resentful that she had
                            been raised with good moral values in a world that didn’t appreciate them. After leaving
                            for college, she was drawn to the secular culture and stopped going to church.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was only in desperation that she occasionally began to seek God’s help. First it was a
                        difficult boss, then it was an inconclusive ultrasound that could indicate a birth defect
                        and then it was financial struggles. God was always there when she needed wisdom
                        and guidance but soon after she forgot him and got lost in the busyness of running her
                        own public relations consultancy, being a wife and the mother of four young children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But God kept seeking her. A flyer offering free childcare was all the incentive Beth
                        needed and she signed up for a Ministry of mother’s Sharing (MOMS) 8-week program
                        being offered at her church. It was a life altering experience. For the first time she was
                        surrounded by other Christian women who spoke of the amazing love and mercy of
                        Jesus and how they surrendered their troubles to him. They had so much joy. Beth
                        wanted that too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shortly after finishing this program Beth and her family moved to Bedford, NH. Despite
                        feeling like he was asking the wrong person, Beth was convinced that God wanted her
                        to start MOMS there. Timidly, she said YES and co-founded the MOMS program. Over
                        10 years the program flourished, and more than 125 women graduated. This one YES
                        blessed Beth in more ways than she could have ever imagined. She met some of her
                        best friends who also became sisters in Christ. She joined in prayer with her MOMS
                        friends and continued to grow in her faith and completed Life in the Spirit. She became
                        a eucharist minister, religious education teacher and even partnered with some of her
                        friends to give Women at the Well retreats for other women searching for a deeper
                        relationship with God. She and her husband Jonathan also joined a catholic couple’s
                        group. They shared so much laughter and joy with the other couples it quickly became
                        the social highlight of their month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In August of 2019, Beth moved with her family to Chapel Hill and is loving her first bible
                        study. She is on the steering committee for the Evangelization prayer group at St. Thomas
                        More. She is a eucharist minister and has taught religious education. She loves sharing
                        the amazing ways God has touched and truly transformed her life.
