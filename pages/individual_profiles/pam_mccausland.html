                    <p class="text-muted">Intercessory Prayer Leader</p>
                    <p>
                        Pam grew up in South Carolina. She received her BA in elementary education from Limestone College now Limestone University in Gaffney SC. She taught for 30 years K-4 in VA. She was named teacher of the year 3 times in her teaching career from Bennett Elementary.  She served on many curriculum committees in Prince William County ranging from the Gifted program to Social Studies and Reading programs. She mentored student teachers and won Grants for her elementary school. When she and her husband moved to Richmond, VA she was chosen to serve as a member of the Clinical Faculty program at VCU and continued to mentor student teachers for Chesterfield County until her retirement in 2010.  She has remained active in education and volunteers as lead teacher for   4th grade at The Learning Trails, a non- profit organization for underprivileged Hispanic students in Chapel Hill, NC.

                        Pam is the oldest of 4 siblings. She was always active in the Methodist Church her family attended. She loved reading the Bible stories and learning about Christ love for others.    She was taught at an early age to talk to Jesus as a friend and to pray for those in need. On December 29, 1969 she and her husband Bob had the first ecumenical wedding at Saint Andrew’s Methodist Church in Orangeburg, SC.   Her minister and the Catholic priest persisted at their wedding. In fact, they were pronounced man and wife twice.  A few years later she joined the Catholic Church. Her love of the sacraments and her caring for those in need led her into an even deeper prayer life. She has always been an active member of the Catholic churches they have attended. One of Pam’s greatest joys is to service as a eucharist minister. Seeing the joy on peoples faces as they receive the body of Christ enriches her spirit.

                        She feels intercessory prayer is a wonderful way to serve the Lord.
