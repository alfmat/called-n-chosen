            <h1>Why there is Hope for everyone in Christ?</h1>
            <h5><mark>- Matt Sebastian</mark></h5>
            <p>
                In the parable of the unforgiving servant (cf. Matt 18:21-25), we see both the merciful side of our Lord, in that he forgave his servant who owed him ten thousand talents, yet we see the side of our Lord’s justice which handed over the servant for torture later when he in turn chose not to forgive his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii. It shows us that our Lord is merciful and just, but before His justice, comes His Mercy. Just as Jesus taught in the Our Father prayer (cf. Matt 6:12), when we obey our Father’s words and do unto to others how we wish would be done unto us, we experience God’s mercy in abundance. In the context of Jesus narrating this parable, He speaks with Peter about forgiving someone’s sins without keeping track of a set number of times (cf. Matt 18:22).
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthering the extent of understanding our Lord’s forgiveness, Jesus shows in the case of the woman caught in adultery (John 8:1-11), that He is willing to meet even the lowliest of sinners where they are in the spiritual life, and forgive their sins. Jesus’ act of compassion and forgiveness showed His love for the sinner, while hating their sin. This was contrary to the legalistic interpretive knowledge of the scriptures that the scribes and Pharisees possessed (cf. Mark 7:1-16), Hence, He was often not legally right by their standards of judgement. However, Jesus didn’t care about pleasing the powers to be, rather extended His mercy to this sinful woman, by forgiving her sins and instructing her to go and sin no more. A key insight to be gleaned here, is that, Jesus redeems us of our sins and wants us to lead a holy life, devoid of sin. Sins inhibits us from receiving God’s grace. We have recourse to His forgiveness when we truly repent and are set back in alignment with His grace through the sacrament of Reconciliation and receiving the Eucharist in a worthy manner. In our pursuit toward holiness and leading a sinless life as Jesus wants to, we may fall again, but it is important to know we have recourse to the redemptive grace of Jesus in this manner.
