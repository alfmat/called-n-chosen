            <h1>A Catholic's Call to Evangelize</h1>
            <h5><mark>- Matt Sebastian</mark></h5>
            <p>
                There is a dire need to evangelize in a world that is steadily going down in sin and losing its moral values. The call to evangelize is the overarching mission of the Church and is as much a call to the Religious Clergy as it is to the laity. However, the average Catholic is faced with the dilemma of being mistaken for proselytizing when attempting to evangelize and tends to hold back. Whereas in reality there are several ways to evangelize without proselytizing. For example Having a loving attitude to a neighbor impresses them and leaves them wondering what is the reason for our love and hope. (Cf 1 Corinthians 13:4-5 “Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude”). But in a gentle way, our Lord directs us to give an answer to anyone asking us to explain the reason for our hope (cf 1 Peter 3:15 “Always be ready to make your defense to anyone who demands from you an accounting for the hope that is in you;”).
            </p>
            <p>
                On learning the core mandate of the Church being that of bearing witness to Christ and spreading the Gospel, it is imperative that the Catholics treat evangelization with dire urgency. To this end, evangelization can be creatively executed, and doesn’t always have to be preaching from the pulpit. Personally, I feel some of the most effective forms of evangelization are one-one when you share what God has done for you in your life with anyone who is open to listen. Your testimony of how God worked in your life and caused a conversion can be a powerful way to evangelize. Sometimes our actions can lead people to experience Christ. Probably the greatest example is Mother Teresa who worked amongst the poor underprivileged Hindu kids in the streets of Calcutta, India, and by her works led others to come to know Christ. St. Francis of Assisi said “Preach the Gospel at all times. When necessary, use words.”. In summary, Catholics – both clergy and laity need to treat evangelization with a sense of urgency. They need to adopt to creative ways to evangelize as mentioned above, in alignment with directives of the Church as in Pope Francis’ exhortation ‘Evangelii Gaudium’ that urges the Church to understand itself as a "community of missionary disciples", who need to “embark on a new chapter of evangelism".
