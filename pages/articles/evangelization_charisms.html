            <h1>The Charisms of the Holy Spirit and Evangelization</h1>
            <h5><mark>- Matt Sebastian</mark></h5>
            <p>
                “Charisms” of the Holy Spirit are gratuitous gifts given by the Holy Spirit to build up the Church. The early Church in its first three hundred plus years, was a wholly charismatic church, and the manifestations of the Holy Spirit were abundant in promulgating the Gospel and expansion of the Church to the far corners of the world. In recent times, specifically (post Vatican II ) in the 1960’s, there has been a call for ‘New Evangelization’ and the charisms of the Holy Spirit to be exercised in new ways for the renewal of the Church. Pope John Paul II on December 11, 1979, addressing the international leaders of the Renewal about the importance of Charismatic Renewal, said “I am convinced that this movement is a very important component of the entire renewal of the Church. This was my own spiritual initiation, so I can understand all these charisms. They are all part of the richness of the Lord. I am convinced that this movement is a sign of his action.” More recently, Pope Francis in his address at St. Peter’s Square on July 3, 2015 quoted Pope Paul VI from the Mass on Pentecost in 1975 where he thanks Cardinal Léon-Joseph Suenens, the great defender of Charismatic Renewal as follows: “In the name of the Lord I thank you for having brought the Charismatic Renewal into the heart of the Church”.

In my own Parish community, we see several charisms at work, especially teaching, generosity, compassion, healing, evangelization, and leadership to name few of the common ones. Whether it be serving in one of the 130+ ministries in our Parish – e.g. Eucharistic Ministry, Intercessory Prayer Ministry, Retreat Ministry, Charismatic Prayer Ministry, Adult Faith Formation et al. these charisms are at work for the common good and building up of the Church. This enables us as a diverse and hospitable Catholic Community to pray, serve and spread the Gospel with joy. Further, these charisms also enable us to realize our higher calling as Catholic Christians by:
<ul>
    <li>
        Allowing the Holy Spirit to speak powerfully to our hearts and grow us toward intentional discipleship.
    </li>
    <li>
        Deepening our prayer lives and dependence on the Holy Spirit in all aspects of our lives.
    </li>
    <li>
        Filling our hearts with zeal to bring others to Christ by spreading the Gospel.
    </li>
</ul>
