            <h1>The Concept of the ONE "Triune God'</h1>
            <h5><mark>- Matt Sebastian</mark></h5>
            <p>
                The concept of the Triune God – the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit has existed right from the beginning, where it is said that the Word was with God. (cf. John 1:1) Further the Holy Spirit is mentioned as ‘A mighty wind’, literally, “spirit or breath [ruah] of God” (cf. Gen 1:2). Further Jesus talks about baptizing in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (cf. Matt 28:18-20). The Nicene Creed further strengthens the fact that that the Son is consubstantial with the Father and begotten not made. Hence, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit can be substantiated as three persons of the Trinitarian Godhead.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lecture notes talk about the Triune God as ‘Creator’, ‘Redeemer’ and ‘Sanctifier’ and the parallels in the Old testament being ‘Wisdom’, ‘Word’ and ‘Spirit’. Advantages of presenting the three persons in the Triune God by their role-based identities are pivotal in that it provides insights into the existence of the trinity, in that God so loved the world, he sent His only begotten son, who while fully divine became fully human in order to redeem mankind from sin. In turn, the Son, at the end of His earthly life, left us with the Holy Spirit the paraclete who reveals and executes God’s plan of salvation. However, a potential disadvantage for someone who lacks full understanding of the trinity, is that the role of each person in the trinity maybe be understood in a silo, rather the overarching entirety of the work being that of the Triune God – e.g. Jesus in His earthly life was not alone – He was in constant union and communication with His Father in Heaven and was led by the Holy Spirit all though his ministry.
