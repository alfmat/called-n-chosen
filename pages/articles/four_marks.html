            <h1>The Four Marks of The Church</h1>
            <h5><mark>- Matt Sebastian</mark></h5>
            <p>
                When I pray the Creed, I understand the Church to have all the four marks attributed to it – One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic, which is embodied in the Roman Catholic Church. However, the word Catholic also means ‘the Whole’ or ‘the Universal’, which makes for compelling inclusion of Christian Churches around the world that imbibe these four attributes – given that even some Protestant Churches see themselves as Catholic due to their claims on their historic adherence to faith and practices that are common to the New Testament Church. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To unambiguously define the Universal nature of the Church it is important to concisely define the four attributes of the Church. ONE Church is used to emphasize the unity of the Church despite its diversity, an analogy being that of one body with many parts as written by St. Paul. Christ is the head of the Church and we, His Mystical Body, are its diverse members. Just as the Holy Spirit unites the Triune Godhead as the love between the Father and the Son, so too, the same Spirit unites the Body of believers as ONE Church (cf. Jn 17:11 and Marthaler p. 308 ’87 edition). The HOLY Church refers to the holiness of the Church by virtue of the gift of the Holy Spirit and its power of sanctification of its human members despite their varying levels of (un)holiness. Further, references to the CATHOLIC (or Universal) nature of the Church can be found as early as the works of St. Ignatius of Antioch dating back to the second century. He writes that the local church only has life and power so long as it part of the universal (Catholic Church) united under its head. To this end, the Church is Catholic in as much as it is united as one. Finally, the Church is Apostolic due to its tradition and founding by the Apostles who were commissioned by Jesus to spread the good news (cf. Jn 15:26-27 and Acts 5:32).

                Given all the divisions and diversions between Christians today, there is need for more ecumenical dialog. The Vatican II council and its Dogmatic Constitution – Lumen Gentium was a great step toward this move to ecumenism. Dialogs between the various Christian Churches could be held in  strategic venues across the world to discuss commonalities in beliefs and faith practices and bring up issues of concern in an environment that fosters trust and respect for the other. Catholic Popes like Pope John Paul II and Pope Francis have acted toward this end, by visiting many countries and fostering multi-lateral dialogs with various church and Christian community leaders to seek an ecumenical solution without compromising the four core attributes of the Church as defined above. To this end, we, the Catholic Church could drive more initiatives to work with committees like ‘The Faith and Order Commission’ and ‘The World Christian Council’ (WCC), in order to expedite the unification of Christian Churches worldwide.
