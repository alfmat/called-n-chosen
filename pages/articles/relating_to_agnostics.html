            <h1>Relating to Agnostics</h1>
            <h5><mark>- Matt Sebastian</mark></h5>
            <p>
                The person I recall when I think about someone who is not necessarily Christian, but has good moral values, is a young man who was my next door neighbor for many years. Although not Christian, but belonging to another faith,  and even being agnostic to that faith for most part,  he displayed rare prudence, courage,temperance and justice, exuding all the cardinal virtues.  He really surprised me in that he had this innate goodness about him,  despite being agnostic and living with no set tenets of structured faith to guide him.  After having known him for a while,  I brought up the subject of Christianity and Jesus, and told him my reason for faith. Although he never challenged my faith, and was receptive to most things that I said,  he was not particularly inclined to go about a set religion. It looked like he was against organized religion but supported the concepts of Christianity by and large. During conversations, I could relate some of his values with Christian moral truths and was further able to engage in dialogue about the core theological virtues of faith, hope and love. At the end of the day we would always agree on certain areas and choose to agree even on the things we disagreed on. I saw a lot of nobility in his values and came to respect him for who he was. I continue to pray for him to come to know our Lord, because I know that faith is a God-given gift to man as much as it is man's response to that gift of God's revelation.
