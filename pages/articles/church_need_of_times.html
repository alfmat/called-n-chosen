            <h1>How does The Church address the need of our times?</h1>
            <h5><mark>- Matt Sebastian</mark></h5>
            <p>
                The greatest cause for concern in the modern world is its tendency to drift further away from God, which has manifested in rampant spread of sins that has threatened the disintegration of the basic unit of society – the family. Resultant effects are scant regard (disrespect) for life as in abortion and euthanasia, alteration to the basic structure of the family as in gay marriage, escalating divorce rates and infidelity /promiscuity that dishonor the sacrament of marriage. Byproducts of a broken family system is a society that is aggressive, nurtures unforgiveness and hates peace and harmony. The resultant manifestations can be seen in societal discord and a 'Godless trend' leading to atheism, relativism and agnosticism affecting many parts of the world today. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                The Church can address these needs and rebuild the moral framework of the society by emphasizing the need to lead good Christian lives and steer its parishioners toward intentional discipleship. Further, the Church must emphasize the importance of reaching out to those who are marginalized in the society, while equipping its clergy, religious and laity to spread the Good News to the masses. The Church’s focus on evangelization along with corporal and spiritual works of mercy can have a global impact on the spread of awareness of God and Godly virtues. This can lead to restoration of the basic family unit thereby orienting society toward God’s plan of goodness and peace. To this end, the Church can also train and hone leaders among its religious and laity to engage with policy makers in areas of social justice and framing policies that respect the dignity of life and advocate alignment with Godly virtues. Finding the lost sheep is primary on our Lord’s heart as explained in the parable of the lost sheep in Luke 15:1-7. To save a culture that is being lost, the Church must earnestly seek the intervention of the Holy Spirit in its efforts to evangelize and pray for salvation of all with its overarching goal being that ‘no soul should be lost’.
