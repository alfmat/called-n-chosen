            <h1>The Church is the 'Universal Sacrament of Salvation'</h1>
            <h5><mark>- Matt Sebastian</mark></h5>
            <p>
                The Church is called the “universal sacrament of salvation” in Lumen Gentium 48, because it was established as the Body of the risen Christ by the power of His Holy Spirit. Jesus is the Word who became flesh, who walked the earth, living as one among us, and who experienced the human frailty while remaining sinless and unblemished. Just as Jesus was the Word, in dying He gave us His body as the ultimate act of love, so He remains in communion with us and save us from sin. This then is our daily saving grace that keeps us gives us spiritual nourishment to go on with our daily lives here on earth. By hence nourishing us with His own body, he makes us partakers of His Divine plan of salvation and wants all of mankind to be drawn to His body as part of this plan.
            </p>
            <p>
                This leads us to an important realization that our temporal lives on earth are really meant to work out our salvation through His Church with the help of His Holy Spirit. Just as important as this is for us, this then is also true for the salvation of all mankind, whether they realize it or not. To this end, Jesus has started His restoration plan for the salvation of all mankind, by sending down His Holy Spirit on all the world - Jews and Gentiles alike, so everyone be drawn to Christ and His Church and be nourished by His Body and Blood. Cf. CCC 737: “The Spirit prepares men and goes out to them with his grace, in order to draw them to Christ.” The Holy Spirit also inspires His Church (i.e. us) to work for the common good of restoration of His Church, by gifting us with charisms for evangelization and drawing people into Christ’s plan of salvation. Cf. CCC 738: “Thus the Church's mission is not an addition to that of Christ and the Holy Spirit, but is its sacrament: in her whole being and in all her members, the Church is sent to announce, bear witness, make present, and spread the mystery of the communion of the Holy Trinity.”. In summary, the core mission of the Church is to bear witness to Christ universally, to all the corners of the world, and proclaim the Gospel and Jesus’ plan for salvation of all mankind.
